### Vanilla JavaScript project

#### Project description

##### In this project, we will embark on creating a visually stunning and contemporary random quote generator using JavaScript. The website will be adorned with an elegant glass morphism design, featuring a captivating title and a thought-provoking quote accompanied by the author's name. To achieve this, we will harness the power of an API to fetch and display these randomly generated quotes. Throughout the development process, we will delve into the intricacies of implementing loading effects by employing try and catch methods and asynchronous functions. Furthermore, we will explore the art of leveraging CSS to craft the mesmerizing glass morphism aesthetic. The end result will be a quote generator that not only captivates with its visual appeal but also excels in functionality, providing users with a seamless experience. It will be effortlessly intuitive to navigate and update, making it an exceptional tool for seeking inspiration and sharing profound wisdom.
